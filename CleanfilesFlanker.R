# This script processes AllTrials.txt (behavioural data) and dynamics.txt (trajectory data) files from the Flanker task (2016) for each participant
# It iterates over the number of participants and extract necessary information from AllTrials.txt and dynamics.txt, then convert these to a csv file and save in their respective folders
# The Convert2Scherbaum.m script then intergrate these csv files to the format appropriate for TCMR analysis.
